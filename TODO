* Heckle the methods to make sure that the specs cover all branches
  within the code.
  * The purpose of this is to make sure we have good test cases
    to use with a Veritas port in the future.

* Refactor specs to use one spec file per public method

* Add to Model and Collection:
  * Add #empty?
  * Add #any?  (handle with and without block)
  * Add #all?  (handle with and without block)
  * Add #none? (handle with and without block) (add to LazyArray for < 1.9)
  * Add #one?  (handle with and without block) (add to LazyArray for < 1.9)
